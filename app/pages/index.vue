    <h1>Hello, I’m sybers 👋</h1>
    <p>
      Also known as <strong>Stanyslas Bres</strong> outside of the internet, I’m a <strong>software engineer</strong> currently crafting solutions at <a
href="https://www.indy.fr/"
        target="_blank">Indy</a>, where we develop an all-in-one accounting platform for freelancers and small
      businesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Originally from the French Alps 🇫🇷, I hold a <strong>Master’s in Computer Science</strong> from
      <a href="https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/" target="_blank">Université Grenoble Alpes</a>.
      I’m passionate about building smooth, user-friendly software experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Along the way, I’ve had the chance to contribute to diverse projects, including <a
href="https://mailbutler.io/"
        target="_blank">Mailbutler.io</a> or
      at <a href="https://www.lahautesociete.com/" target="_blank">La Haute Société</a>,
      and even research at the <a href="https://www.liglab.fr/fr" target="_blank">Grenoble Computer Science
        Laboratory</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, I work as a part-time <strong>freelancer</strong>,
      helping startups and small businesses with their software development needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      I designed and developed the website for <a href="https://elyosis.art" target="_blank">Elyosis</a>, showcasing
      their video production work,
      and for <a href="https://www.casa-belle.fr" target="_blank">Casa Belle</a>, highlighting their charming B&B
      offerings.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also enjoy sharing my knowledge, having taught Node.js to students at <a
href="https://www.mydigitalschool.com"
        target="_blank">MyDigitalSchool</a> in Grenoble.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of work, I enjoy drum and bass music, photography, and discovering new places 🌏.
